## Test-driven development (TDD)


> This is an application that tests method called fizzbuzz that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns a string. The returned string is constructed following these rules:

- When N is divisible by 3, return "fizz".
- When N is divisible by 5, return "buzz".
- When N is divisible by 3 and 5, return "fizzbuzz".
- Any other case, return N as a string (e.g. say N is 7 then return "7").
